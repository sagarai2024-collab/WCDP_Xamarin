**WCDP** is a cross-platform workforce management suite built with **Xamarin.Forms** (Android, iOS, Windows desktop) using **C#** and **MVVM**. It enables employees to punch timesheets, track timecards and attendance, and receive task assignments, while admins manage tasks, users, and reports on a Windows desktop app. The solution integrates with secure APIs, supports data synchronization, and uses **AWS** for CI/CD and hosting.
